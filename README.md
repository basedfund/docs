# Introduction to Bedrock

Bedrock is a suite of products focused on enabling users and companies grow their funds via Decentralized Finance (DeFi). At its core, It provides depositors with a way continuously investing in a variety of crypto currencies using the Ethereum and other blockchains. The key difference between bedrock and other platforms is that deposits are actively managed, used to trade in and out of positions throughout a period of time in the hope of reducing volatility.&#x20;

The product is maintained and developed by various independent contributors within the cryptocurrency space and backed by BASED, a crypto investment fund. Management of the protocol will eventually be governed by holders of the BEDROCK token.&#x20;

#### Core Product



Bedrock protocol is a set of smart contracts that accept select DeFi assets, most notably stablecoins and assets designed to be pegged to another asset. A peg is the practice of fixing the exchange rate of a currency to the value of another currency. Once an asset is deposited into a Bedrock Strategy the asset is used as margin to trade a given strategy available on the platform.&#x20;



#### Why

The goal of the platform is to provide users and institutions with a way of managing crypto volatility and leverage some of the strategies used by the worlds leading hedge funds.&#x20;



#### How we are different

While you can buy and hold via Bedrock we have found that this strategy can lead to extreme volatitliy with drawdowns as large as 80% within a year. Our goal is to provide exposure to the growth of crypto assets with a fraction of the volatility.&#x20;

#### Networks

Bedrock is currently designed to work on **Ethereum, and Starkware**. While we envision supporting other EVM compatible chains, our current design enables us to insure assets that are native to Ethereum main-net.

#### Progress

BedRock is currently beta software and is not publicly available.\
We are actively looking for contributors with experience in Solidity, React, Business Development and Community Design.
