# Introduction to Bedrock

Bedrock is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that at its core provides depositors with insurance against depeg events on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is maintained and developed by various independent contributors within the cryptocurrency space and backed by BASED, a crypto investment fund. Management of the protocol is governed by holders of the BEDROCK token.&#x20;

#### Core Product



Bedrock protocol is a set of smart contracts that accept select DeFi assets, most notably stablecoins and assets designed to be pegged to another asset. A peg is the practice of fixing the exchange rate of a currency to the value of another currency. Once an asset is deposited into a Bedrock Vault the asset is covered by the rules of that vault. Our initial use case covers an asset losing its value beyond some stated amount.&#x20;



#### Why

In 2021, criminal hackers stole approximately $3.2 billion in cryptocurrency â€”and the victims are disproportionately in **DeFi**.

#### Problem

Existing DeFi insurance solutions mimic traditional institutions. Claim incentives are misaligned, and premium pricing is ad-hoc. Most protocols have a human element which can lead to impartial reimbursement processes.&#x20;



#### How we are different

On BedRock you deposit Defi assets to pool and spread risk with like-minded users and protocols.\
Users are both the insured , receiving compensation in the case of a depeg and insurer offering coverage to others within the protocol.

#### Networks

Bedrock is currently designed to work on **Ethereum**. While we envision supporting other EVM compatible chains, our current design enables us to insure assets that are native to Ethereum main-net.

#### Progress

BedRock is currently alpha software and is not publicly available.\
We are actively looking for contributors with experience in Solidity, React and Community Design.
