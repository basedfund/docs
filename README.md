# Introduction to Bedrock

Bedrock is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that at its core provides depositors with insurance against De-peg events on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is maintained and developed by various independent contributors within the cryptocurrency space and backed by BASED, a crypto investment fund. Management of the protocol is governed by holders of the BEDROCK token.&#x20;

#### Core Product



Bedrock protocol is a set of smart contracts that accept select DeFi assets, most notably stablecoins and assets designed to be pegged to another asset. A peg is the practice of fixing the exchange rate of a currency to the value of another currency. Once an asset is deposited into a Bedrock Safe the asset is covered by the rules of that Safe Our initial use case covers an asset losing its value beyond some stated amount.&#x20;



#### Why

In 2021, criminal hackers stole approximately $3.2 billion in cryptocurrency â€”and the victims are disproportionately in **DeFi**.

#### Problem

Existing DeFi insurance solutions mimic traditional institutions. Claim incentives are misaligned, and premium pricing is ad-hoc. Most protocols have a human element which can lead to impartial reimbursement processes.&#x20;



#### How we are different

On BedRock you deposit Defi assets to pool and spread risk with like-minded users and protocols.\
Users are both the insured , receiving compensation in the case of a De-peg and Insurer offering coverage to others within the protocol.

#### Networks

Bedrock is currently designed to work on **Ethereum**. While we envision supporting other EVM compatible chains, our current design enables us to insure assets that are native to Ethereum main-net.

#### Progress

BedRock is currently beta software and is not publicly available.\
We are actively looking for contributors with experience in Solidity, React and Community Design.
