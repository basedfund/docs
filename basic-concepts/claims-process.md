# Claims Process

If a claimable event for a given vault has occurred then the depositor may proceed to request a claim with the protocol. Claims can be processed directly via interactions with our smart contracts or via our dApp.&#x20;

#### Validation and reimbursement&#x20;

1. The protocol will validate the De-peg event by validating price history form the supported protocols
2. The protocol will then validate that the users wallet is a valid depositor into the vault.&#x20;
3. Once confirmed the protocol will lock platform assets to calculate a reimbursement amount
4. The reimbursement amount will be a proportional share of the users assets of based on the Total value locked in the protocol minus fees.&#x20;
5. In order to ensure the depositor is not only receiving devalued assets, they will also receive alternative assets controlled by the protocol as compensation.&#x20;

#### Example:&#x20;

[Jonathan Wengel](https://app.gitbook.com/u/LwUf0NCikmVsDn5fTZtrEQKyDCY2 "mention")can you add an example of how claims reimbursement would work with the current code?
