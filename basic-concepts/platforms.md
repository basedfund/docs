# Platforms

In order to power the strategies used on Bedrock we integrate with various DeFi platforms. Not all of the following are live but are in progress.&#x20;

#### Gnosis

Gnosis safes are used where possible to secure assets across varios EVM chains.&#x20;

**Smart contract wallets**

A smart contract wallet is a digital wallet that uses smart contracts for enhanced security and customizable features. Unlike traditional wallets, it allows for programmable control, supports multi-signature transactions, and integrates seamlessly with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, offering a user-friendly interface for managing digital assets with advanced functionality.

**UniSwap**

Uniswap is the most popular decentralized exchange for crypto assets&#x20;

**Perpetual exchanges**

A perpetual exchange is a trading platform for perpetual contracts, which are derivatives similar to futures but without an expiry date. These exchanges offer high leverage, use a funding rate mechanism to align contract prices with the underlying asset, and typically feature high liquidity. They are popular in the cryptocurrency market for speculative trading and price discovery.
