# Safes

Bedrock stores assets deposited into the protocol in a Safe. Each Safe has unique criteria that determine what would be considered a claimable event. At the moment the following Safes are supported:&#x20;

* USDC&#x20;
* USDT
* DAI

Each safe will outline at what price point a De-peg event will quality for a claim.&#x20;



Safes may or may not have fees associated to them including:&#x20;



**A deposit fee:** A fee charged to access coverage offered by the Bedrock Safe

**A withdraw parameter:** The withdraw parameter calculates a fee charged to those who require instant withdrawal when the Safes are unlocked. You can learn more about the withdrawal process here.&#x20;

**A claim fee:** A fee charged by the protocol to process a claimable event. Typically represented as a percentage of your claim amount.&#x20;

</strong>asset is no longer valid. </code></pre>
