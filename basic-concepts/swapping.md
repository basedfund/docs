# Swapping

If a user deposited assets that have not experienced a de-peg event and those assets were used to compensate any one requesting a claim, then the user has received Bedrock tokens as part of their compensation.&#x20;

Bedrock tokens will be used for Governance, privileged access to new products and compensation.&#x20;

These tokens represent a share of the Bedrock community pool and can be redeemed for the users proportional share of the pool.



Example:&#x20;

* 10 BRK tokens are deposited in a users balance
* There are 10,000 BRK tokens in circulation&#x20;
* The community pool contains 10,000 USDC
* The user can choose to swap his/her 10 BRK for 10 USD
