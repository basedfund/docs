# FAQ

#### What is Bedrock Protocol?

Bedrock is a productl built on Ethereum focused on providing access to hedgefund like strategies within the world of DeFi.&#x20;

#### How does Bedrock work?

Deposit any of the supported DeFi assets into one of our **Bedrock Strategies** . We will then use those funds to actively trade on your behalf by following one of the live strategies available to Investors on the platform. \
\
Users can withdraw assets from the protocol during one of the redemption windows. Each strategy has a fee model that is displayed to users ranging from 1% of assets under management up to 20% of the return.&#x20;

In order to avoid malicious actors we lock assets with a withdraw delay.

#### What type of assets will Bedrock support?

We are prioritizing the most popular stable coins initially then proceeding to secure DeFi assets with large amounts of value locked.&#x20;

#### Is there a token?

There is no publicly available token at this moment in time. We are planning to reward early adopters and contributors via a ERC-20 token once our governance model has been finalized.
